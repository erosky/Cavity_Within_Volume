Interested in making a 

1nm = 10 angstroms

have been simulating 50 cubic angstroms, so would be 5 cubic nanometers



Would be interested in 1 - 3 nm radius droplet sizes for very noticeable pressure effects.
1 nm drop --> 10 Angstrom radius --> would want box size of 60 Angstroms
2 nm drop --> 20 Angstrom radius --> would want 120 Angstrom box dimensions? (maybe keep N constant)
3 nm drop --> 30 Angstrom radius --> minimum box size of 100 Angstrom? or 120 Angstrom


lets think about the 120 Angstrom 3nm case
Volume of liquid water: We have 120^3 - 4/3*pi*(30)^3 = 

Would require N water molecules 
approximately 0.03278 N/A^3

we would have less than 10,000 water molecules if we use a radius of 1.5 nm and have 1.5 nm of water on each side as well. This should be okay as a 1.5 cubic volume has on the order of 100 water molecules in it, but unfortunately thats only 4 or 5 molecules along each axis.

Initially, we will be using a radius of curvature that corresponds to -1000 Atm of negative laplace pressure (using the mW model surface tension computed by Li et. al.)
This is so that I can compare the results to the results from bulk water that has -1000 Atm pressure imposed.
The amount of volume surrounding the cavity is chosen so that the volume of water is the same as the volume used in the bulk simulations at both 1 atm and -1000 atm. 
This is due to the fact that nucleation rate is an extensive property so that the larger the volume the more likely for nucleation to take place.
In this case, it was 4096 water molecules.

* Must determine cutoff distance to use for ML order parameter
* Must determine surface tension for ML - ask Tianshu Li how they did this?


Indentor cavity with nph and temp/csvr - barostat at 1 atm and cooling ramp of 0.5 K/ns
Results:
1. Volume contracts during equilibration, but ending density is still very comprable to bulk water measurement.
2. Average homogeneous freezing temperature is the same as for 1 atm bulk water
Remaining:
*** should compare density to that of bulk water, and maybe average order parameter? - take average of log file N/(vol-cavity)
*** would like to try this with nvt instead of nph - does pressure stay around the 1 atm starting value
** during equilibration should check the stress/atom compared to computed pressure


Free cavity with nvt - equilibrated at 1 Atm, and nve, with indentor in place. Ran with Nose/Hoover NVT
Results:
1. Water fills in cavity within two nanoseconds
2. Pressure becomes a negative value
3. Volume remains constant due to nvt
4. MSD is steep and then less steep once cavity is filled in
5. Potential energy drops to a lower stable value once cavity is filled in
6. Pressure is same as that computed with stress/atom using full system volume
Remaining:
*** compare density to that of bulk water


Next Simulations:

Indentor cavity with nvt (but still equilibrated at 1 atm? - will depend on how density compares to bulk, and how stress/atom measurement compares to computed pressure )
*** volume doesn't really change much after the water has been equilibrated at 1 Atm... so fixing volume may not have any influence on the freezing temperature. But perhaps removing the barostat will have an influence? Will the pressure remain around 1 Atm or will it drift to another value
1. Pressure remains around 1 Atm during beginning, at the end it has ~400 Atm, maybe after freezing.



 Free cavity with nvt and barostat? Does cavity fill in the same way?


measuring order parameter of the spherical shell
- set up radial shell that counts as the surface and option for either inside or outside to be the "Bulk"

Later step would be to calculate surface tension (refer to that paper)

immediate next steps:
plot pressure v time for those old nvt runs
can just set up the cylindrical configurations under different conditions for enough timesteps that I can get good statistics on the order parameter as a function of radius.

sim cylinder "droplet" of same rad



-------
Pressure

computing stress/atom and summing and dividing by 3*V where V is the volume of the cylindrical droplet does not work.
