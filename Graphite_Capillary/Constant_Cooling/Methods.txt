set up for running on portage.
cooling at a rate of 0.25 K/ns
225K to 210K



larger radius of droplet is roughly 42.65 Angstroms
making total surface area of droplet-graphite interface to be 2 x 5690.5 square angstroms
11381 square angstroms

This area is slightly over 2x more than in the case of bulk water sandwiched between graphite plates.
