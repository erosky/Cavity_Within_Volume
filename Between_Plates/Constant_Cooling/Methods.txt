set up for running on portage.
cooling at a rate of 0.25 K/ns
first 5 runs will be 230 to 205 and can narrrow temp range based on results

x recreate setup starting at 230 K
x will be a 100 ns simulation to cool to 205 K
- put configuration data and new script into portage_files
x change larger radius of cylinder to 55A so that the bulk-like section is the same volume as the bulk simulations in 50x50x50 b
	x change core sizes and volumes
	x compute CoM of Bridge





Portland
x setup gitlab then move scripts to research machine, so gabe can run them
x setup between plates cooling ramps for gabe to run
x Manuscript edits

BUS: 
x analyze desnity v pressure, 
x setup cooling ramps to be run on research machine, 
- email about portage.

Nevada City
- Check one run of water bridge before having gabe run script
x plot density vs pressure
- analyze first 5 or 10 between plate cooling ramps
- run more cooling ramps
- Finish c++ code

San Diego
- Spicule Studies


Tuesday:
- email about portage
- c++ code

Wednesday:
- spicule study
- analyze simmys
