For each run, find average surface area and std deviation.
Then, average over all runs.
Print data to surfacearea_summary.data


**** THE temperature in the timestep files are off by 5 kelvin!


1 -- use calculate_surface_area.sh to scan through dumpfiles, this scripts invokes find_surface.awk
2 -- use sum_surface_area.py to get surface area data for each run
3 -- use sum_runs.py to get the average data for all runs
