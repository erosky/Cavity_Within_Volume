We want to get a sense of the density profile within the Ibeam capillary.


For each z-bin we want to know the average density
- for each z-bin, find the average densiy averaged over y-bin
- where the y-bin density is N_in_bin / bin_volume 
- where bin_volume = (max_x - min_x)*y_binw*z_binw
- the average density in that z-layer is the average density of all y-bins


Possible additional steps:
- exclude molecules at the liquid-vacuum interface
