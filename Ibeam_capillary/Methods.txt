Create a "I-beam" shaped capillary bridge between two graphite plates.

Surface area of water against substrate should be the same as for the bulk between plates.
The area of once water-graphite interface should be 2,412.75 square angstroms

We do not barostat the configuration, The capillary may take whatever form and internal pressure that it desires.
Since the capillary is surrounded by vacuum, the ambient pressure is 0 atm.

We will cool the configuration at a constant cooling rate and observe it's nucleation rate... Does it show effects of negative pressure?

1 atm heterogeneous freezing is 230K
-500 atm heterogeneous freezing is 235K
To cover the range, we will cool from 240K to 225K (15K range)


Approximate volume of water:
4 layers --- 35 x 68.926 x 12 = 28,949.92 cubic angstroms
6 layers --- 35 x 68.926 x 18 = 43423.38 (1355 water molecules)
8 layers --- 35 x 68.926 x 24 = 57897.84 (1794 water molecules)
^ These can all be refined using the "construct surface mesh" tool in ovito

Need to add 11.46 Angstroms onto y axis in order to get the desired surface area.


10 layers thick --- 30
